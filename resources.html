                House Price data are obtained from nationwide. Regional House Price indices for 13 regions of the UK are published quarterly by the Nationwide. To transform the data into real values, each regional series is deflated with consumer price index (CPI). Regional
                income data is obtained from the Family Expenditure Survey (FES). For each year, starting from 1975, the dataset is split by region and the data on average total household's weekly expenditure is extracted. The annual data is then interpolated
                to obtain quarterly series.
            </p>

                <li>
                    The FES runs from 1961 to 2001. From 2001 it was replaced by a new survey, the Expenditure and Food Survey (EFS), which became the Living Costs and Food Survey (LCF) from 2008."

                <li>
                    Due to the differences in regional classifications, Outer Metropolitan and Outer South East are assumed to correspond to the South East region in the regional classification adopted by the FES.

        <h3>Monitoring Exuberance and Collapses in Housing Markets</h3>

        <div class="container text-justify">
            <p>
                A rapid pace of real house price appreciation by itself does not necessarily imply that real house prices are becoming out of step with fundamentals. Still, we recognize that real house price increases today could become out of step with fundamentals
                supported instead by the expectation of robust future price increases. If enough buyers share the same beliefs about the future prospects in the housing market, their purchases will help drive current house prices up and validate the expectation
                that strong house price gains will continue. This self-fulfilling prophecy keeps the housing market misaligned from its fundamentals until enough investors become leery of a bust, the flow of money into housing dries out, and eventually
                the feared collapse occurs.
            </p>
            <p>
                An expectations-driven real house price appreciation may lead to a misallocation of resources in the economy and distorted investment patterns. Therefore, monitoring for such episodes of exuberance (booms) and collapse (busts) in housing markets may help
                avoid a repeat of the economic trauma caused by the international boom-bust housing cycle that preceded the 2008 Great Recession (Pavlidis et al., 2016). We take a look at International housing markets (Mack and Martínez-García, 2011)
                with the novel Generalized Sup ADF (GSADF) test of Phillips et al. (2015a,b) to detect empirical evidence of exuberance. The latest findings across all international housing markets are summarized in this website.

        <h2 class="text-center">House Price Uncertainty</h2>
        <div class="container text-justify">
            <p>
                The House Price Uncertainty (HPU) Index is constructed using the methodology suggested by Baker, Bloom and Davis (2016)to proxy for economic policy uncertainty. The HPU is an index of search results from five large newspapers in the UK: The Guardian,
                The Independent, The Times, Financial Times and Daily Mail. In particular, we use LexisNexis digital archives of these newspapers to obtain a quarterly count of articles that contain the following three terms: ‘uncertainty’ or ‘uncertain’;
                ‘housing’ or ‘house prices’ or ‘real estate’; and one of the following: ‘policy’, ‘regulation’, ‘Bank of England, ‘mortgage’, ‘interest rate’, ‘stamp-duty’, ‘tax’, ‘bubble’ or ‘buy-to-let’ (including variants like ‘uncertainties’, ‘housing
                market’ or ‘regulatory’). To meet the search criteria an article must contain terms in all three categories.
            </p>
            <p>
                The resulting series of search counts is then scaled by the total number of articles in the given newspaper and in the given quarter. Finally, to obtain the HPU index, we average across the five newspapers by quarter and normalise the index to a mean
                of 100.The Index starts in 1982 Q1. we briefly note here the following stylised facts about the Index.
            </p>

            <ul class="text-left">
                <li>
                    The UK has experienced two recessions over the period 1982-2018. The first one 1990 Q3 –1991 Q3 and the second one 2008 Q2 –2009 Q2. HPUincreases ahead of those two periods and it reaches an (up to that point) historical maximum right at the beginningof
                    the economic recessions (228 in 1990 Q3 and 316in 2008 Q3).
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Uncertainty Index increased ahead of the EU Referendum and nearly reached its 2008Q3 level right after the referendum took place (306in 2016 Q3). While the index dropped during the first half of 2018 to a value close to 100, it has started rapidly
                    increasing in the second half of the year, reaching 211 at the start of 2019. The Index is standing at 158 as of today. Uncertainty generated by (i) the domestic political situation, (ii) the negotiations with the EU about the withdrawal
                    agreement, and (iii) the outcome of Brexit and its consequences are having a direct impact on the housing market.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The volatility of the Index significantly increased since 2007 and remained high ever since.
